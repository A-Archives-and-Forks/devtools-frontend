## Bumping.

First, go update rebuild.sh to specify the version you want. Then run the rebuild script:

```bash
./front_end/third_party/web-vitals/rebuild.sh
```

## DevTools edits to web-vitals

1. There's a sed edit in the rebuild.sh to expose `attributeINP`. That'll continue in v5 but be harder to do.
2. Minor manual edits (ctrl+f "cdt-modification"):
   * some lines are manually commented out in `attribution/onINP.js`'s `saveInteractionTarget`.  b/376777343 Unknown if needed in v5.
3. (Not part of package, but..) There's a hack to clear `interactionTargetElement` in our own web-vitals-injected that won't be necessary in v5.
